My pride and joy! I must have spent 100 hours plus on this project.

The app showcases two products and asks the user to vote for which one they think is better value.

It then ranks the products using an ELO rating, allowing the admins to view the total list of products sorted by value.

Other features include the ability to get paid in Monero for voting, the contact me page, and the email verification (still in beta).
